#  Java Chess Engine with JavaFX GUI

* A fully interactive chess application built in Java, featuring:

* A custom-built chess engine written from the ground up

*A JavaFX graphical user interface

* Move validation, legal-move generation, check/checkmate detection, and basic AI searching

* Modular architecture designed for easy extension or future improvements



# Features
# Core Game Logic

Complete implementation of chess rules:

Piece movement

Check, checkmate, stalemate

Castling

En passant

Pawn promotion

Turn tracking, legal-move validation, and board-state integrity checks

#  JavaFX GUI

Drag-and-drop or click-based move selection

Highlighted legal moves

Real-time board updates

Undo/redo support (if implemented in your version)

Customizable board themes (optional depending on your build)

# Chess Engine (AI)

Depending on what you built, usually includes:

Minimax or alpha-beta search

Evaluation function using piece-square tables or material scoring

Adjustable search depth

Move ordering optimizations (optional)

Even if partially implemented, the project structure allows you to continue easily in the future.

# Why This Repo Exists

This project represents a significant learning experience in Java, algorithms, and game architecture. Although development has paused, the codebase is preserved so that it can be resumed or used as a reference in the future.
